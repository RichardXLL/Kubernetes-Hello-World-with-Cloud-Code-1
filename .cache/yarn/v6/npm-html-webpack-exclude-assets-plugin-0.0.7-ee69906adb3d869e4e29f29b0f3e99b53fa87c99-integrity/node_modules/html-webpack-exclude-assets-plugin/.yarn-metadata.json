    "readme": "Exclude Assets extension for the HTML Webpack Plugin\n========================================\n[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesjieye/html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin) [![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)\n\nEnhances [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)\nfunctionality by adding the `{excludeAssets: RegExp | [RegExp]}` option to allow you to exclude assets.\n\nWhen adding an entry with third party css files, for example, `style: ['bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css']`, to webpack, the injected scripts include style.js or style.[chunkhash].js. The `excludeChunks` option of `html-webpack-plugin` will exclude both style.css and style.js. With this plugin, you can keep style.css in and style.js out by setting `excludeAssets: /style.*.js/`.\n\nYou can also exclude CSS assets, for example, a theme CSS style, by setting `excludeAssets: /theme.*.css/`.\n\nInstallation\n------------\nYou must be running webpack on Node v4.0.0 or higher.\n\nNote: `style-loader`'s dependency `loader-utils` only supports Node v4.0.0 since v1.0. See `style-loader`'s [#174 pull request](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/pull/174) for details.\n\nInstall the plugin with npm:\n```shell\n$ npm install --save-dev html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin\n```\n\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\nRequire the plugin in your webpack config:\n\n```javascript\nvar HtmlWebpackExcludeAssetsPlugin = require('html-webpack-exclude-assets-plugin');\n```\n\nAdd the plugin to your webpack config as follows:\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),\n  new HtmlWebpackExcludeAssetsPlugin()\n]  \n```\n\nThe above configuration will actually do nothing due to the configuration defaults.\n\nWhen you set `excludeAssets` to an array of regular expressions or a single regular expression, the matched assets will be skipped when the chunks are injected into the HTML template.\n\n```javascript\nplugins: [\n  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n    excludeAssets: [/style.*.js/] // exclude style.js or style.[chunkhash].js \n  }),\n  new HtmlWebpackExcludeAssetsPlugin()\n]  \n```\n",
