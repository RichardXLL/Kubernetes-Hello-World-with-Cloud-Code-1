    "readme": "# gatsby-transformer-sharp\n\nCreates `ImageSharp` nodes from image types that are supported by the\n[Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) image processing library and provides\nfields in their GraphQL types for processing your images in a variety of ways\nincluding resizing, cropping, and creating responsive images.\n\n[Live demo](https://image-processing.gatsbyjs.org/)\n([source](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/examples/image-processing))\n\n## Install\n\n`npm install --save gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-plugin-sharp`\n\n## How to use\n\n```javascript\n// In your gatsby-config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [`gatsby-plugin-sharp`, `gatsby-transformer-sharp`],\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that you must have a source plugin (which brings in images) installed in your project. Otherwise, no `ImageSharp` nodes can be created for your files. Examples would be [`gatsby-source-filesystem`](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem) or source plugins for (headless) CMSs like [`gatsby-source-wordpress`](/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress).\n\n**Note**: An exception to this is when using [`gatsby-source-contentful`](/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/), as the source plugin and the assets are not [downloaded to the local filesystem](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-contentful/#download-assets-for-static-distribution). By default, the `gatsby-source-contentful` plugin creates a `ContentfulAsset` node for every image with links to Contentfulâ€™s CDN, therefore it is not necessary to use `gatsby-transformer-sharp` together with `gatsby-source-contentful`.\n\n## Parsing algorithm\n\nIt recognizes files with the following extensions as images.\n\n- jpeg\n- jpg\n- png\n- webp\n- tif\n- tiff\n\nEach image file is parsed into a node of type `ImageSharp`.\n\n## Configuration options\n\n`checkSupportedExtensions` [boolean][optional]\n\nSharp only supports certain image formats (see the Parsing algorithm section above) and hence throws a warning when you e.g. use a .gif in an `ImageSharp` query. You'll need to use `publicURL` instead. With this option you can disable the warning behavior.\n\n```javascript\n// In your gatsby-config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    `gatsby-plugin-sharp`,\n    {\n      resolve: `gatsby-transformer-sharp`,\n      options: {\n        // The option defaults to true\n        checkSupportedExtensions: false,\n      },\n    },\n  ],\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Incompatible library version: sharp.node requires version X or later, but Z provides version Y\n\nThis means that there are multiple incompatible versions of the `sharp` package installed in `node_modules`. The complete error typically looks like this:\n\n```text\nSomething went wrong installing the \"sharp\" module\n\ndlopen(/Users/misiek/dev/gatsby-starter-blog/node_modules/sharp/build/Release/sharp.node, 1): Library not loaded: @rpath/libglib-2.0.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/misiek/dev/gatsby-starter-blog/node_modules/sharp/build/Release/sharp.node\n  Reason: Incompatible library version: sharp.node requires version 6001.0.0 or later, but libglib-2.0.dylib provides version 5801.0.0\n```\n\nTo fix this, you'll need to update all Gatsby plugins in the current project that depend on the `sharp` package. Here's a list of official plugins that you might need to update in case your projects uses them:\n\n- `gatsby-plugin-sharp`\n- `gatsby-plugin-manifest`\n- `gatsby-remark-images-contentful`\n- `gatsby-source-contentful`\n- `gatsby-transformer-sharp`\n- `gatsby-transformer-sqip`\n\nTo update these packages, run:\n\n```shell\nnpm install gatsby-plugin-sharp gatsby-plugin-manifest gatsby-remark-images-contentful gatsby-source-contentful gatsby-transformer-sharp gatsby-transformer-sqip\n```\n\nIf updating these doesn't fix the issue, your project probably uses other plugins from the community that depend on a different version of `sharp`. Try running `npm list sharp` or `yarn why sharp` to see all packages in the current project that use `sharp` and try updating them as well.\n",
