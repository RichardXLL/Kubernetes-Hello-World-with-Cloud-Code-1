It is the logical opposite of the `aria-hidden` attribute.\n\nIn the following example, screen readers will announce \"Save\" and will ignore the icon; the browser displays the icon and ignores the text.\n\n```jsx\nimport VisuallyHidden from \"@reach/visually-hidden\";\n\nfunction Example() {\n  return (\n    <button>\n      <VisuallyHidden>Save</VisuallyHidden>\n      <span aria-hidden>ðŸ’¾</span>\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n",
