Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.\n\n## Features\n\n- Content management and retrieval through Contentful's [Content Management API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/).\n- Built in rate limiting with recovery procedures\n- Asset processing helpers\n\n## Supported environments\n\nBrowsers and Node.js:\n\n- Chrome\n- Firefox\n- Edge\n- Safari\n- node.js (LTS)\n- IE11 (with [legacy version](#legacy-browsers) of the library)\n\nOther browsers should also work, but at the moment we're only running automated tests on the browsers and Node.js versions specified above.\n\n# Getting started\n\nTo get started with the Contentful Management JS SDK you'll need to install it, and then get credentials which will allow you to access your content in Contentful.\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Authentication](#authentication)\n- [Using ES6 import](#using-es6-import)\n- [Your first request](#your-first-request)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Documentation/References](#documentationreferences)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Node:\n\nUsing [npm](http://npmjs.org):\n\n```sh\nnpm install contentful-management\n```\n\nUsing [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/):\n\n```sh\nyarn add contentful-management\n```\n\n### Browser:\n\nFor browsers, we recommend to download the SDK via npm or yarn to ensure 100% availability.\n\nIf you'd like to use a standalone built file you can use the following script tag or download it from [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/contentful-management), under the `dist` directory:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/contentful-management@latest/dist/contentful-management.browser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n**It's not recommended to use the above URL for production.**\n\nUsing `contentful@latest` will always get you the latest version, but you can also specify a specific version number:\n\n```html\n<!-- Avoid using the following url for production. You can not rely on its availability. -->\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/contentful-management@4.0.1/dist/contentful-management.browser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nThe Contentful Management SDK will be accessible via the `contentfulManagement` global variable.\n\nCheck the [releases](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js/releases) page to know which versions are available.\n\n### Typings\n\nThis library also comes with typings to use with typescript.\n\n### Legacy browsers:\n\nThis library also comes with a legacy version to support Internet Explorer 11 and other older browsers. It already contains a polyfill for Promises.\n\nTo support legacy browsers in your application, use `contentful-management.legacy.min.js` instead of `contentful-management.browser.min.js`\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo get content from Contentful, an app should authenticate with an OAuth bearer token.\n\nIf you want to use this SDK for a simple tool or a local app that you won't redistribute or make available to other users, you can get an API key for the Management API at our [Authentication page](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/).\n\nIf you'd like to create an app which would make use of this SDK but that would be available for other users, where they could authenticate with their own Contentful credentials, make sure to also check out the section about [Creating an OAuth Application](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/authentication/#creating-an-oauth-20-application)\n\n## Using ES6 import\n\nYou can use the es6 import with the SDK as follow\n\n```js\n// import createClient directly\nimport { createClient } from 'contentful-management'\nvar client = createClient({\n  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app\n  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',\n})\n//....\n```\n\nOR\n\n```js\n// import everything from contentful\nimport * as contentful from 'contentful-management'\nvar client = contentful.createClient({\n  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app\n  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',\n})\n// ....\n```\n\n## Your first request\n\nThe following code snippet is the most basic one you can use to get content from Contentful with this SDK:\n\n```js\nvar contentful = require('contentful-management')\nvar client = contentful.createClient({\n  // This is the access token for this space. Normally you get the token in the Contentful web app\n  accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',\n})\n\n// This API call will request a space with the specified ID\nclient.getSpace('spaceId').then((space) => {\n  // Now that we have a space, we can get entries from that space\n  space.getEntries().then((entries) => {\n    console.log(entries.items)\n  })\n\n  // let's get a content type\n  space.getContentType('product').then((contentType) => {\n    // and now let's update its name\n    contentType.name = 'New Product'\n    contentType.update().then((updatedContentType) => {\n      console.log('Update was successful')\n    })\n  })\n})\n```\n\nYou can try and change the above example at [Tonic](https://tonicdev.com/npm/contentful-management).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- **I can't Install the package via npm** - Check your internet connection - It is called `contentful-management` and not `contenful-management` ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯\n- **Can I use the SDK in react native projects** - Yes it is possible\n- **I get the error: Unable to resolve module `http`** - Our SDK is supplied as node and browser version. Most non-node environments, like React Native, act like a browser. To force using of the browser version, you can require it via: `const { createClient } = require('contentful-management/dist/contentful-management.browser.min.js')`\n- **I am not sure what payload to send when creating and entity (Asset/Entity/ContentType etc...)** - Check the Content Management API [docs](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/) or the examples in the reference [docs](https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js) - Feel free to open an issue if you didn't find what you need in the above links\n- 😱 **something is wrong what should I do** - If it is a bug related to the code create a GitHub issue and make sure to remove any credential for your code before sharing it. - If you need to share your credentials, for example you have an issue with your space, please create a support ticket. - Please **do not** share your management token in a GitHub issue\n\n## Documentation/References\n\nTo help you get the most out of this SDK, we've prepared reference documentation, tutorials and other examples that will help you learn and understand how to use this library.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe `createClient` method supports several options you may set to achieve the expected behavior:\n\n```js\ncontentful.createClient({\n  ... your config here ...\n})\n```\n\n#### accessToken (required)\n\nYour CMA access token.\n\n#### host (default: `'api.contentful.com'`)\n\nSet the host used to build the request URI's.\n\n#### hostUpload (default: `'upload.contentful.com'`)\n\nSet the host used to build the upload related request uri's.\n\n#### basePath (default: ``)\n\nThis path gets appended to the host to allow request urls like `https://gateway.example.com/contentful/` for custom gateways/proxies.\n\n#### httpAgent (default: `undefined`)\n\nCustom agent to perform HTTP requests. Find further information in the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config).\n\n#### httpsAgent (default: `undefined`)\n\nCustom agent to perform HTTPS requests. Find further information in the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config).\n\n#### headers (default: `{}`)\n\nAdditional headers to attach to the requests. We add/overwrite the following headers:\n\n- Content-Type: `application/vnd.contentful.management.v1+json`\n- X-Contentful-User-Agent: `sdk contentful-management.js/1.2.3; platform node.js/1.2.3; os macOS/1.2.3`\n  (Automatically generated)\n\n#### proxy (default: `undefined`)\n\nAxios proxy configuration. See the [axios request config documentation](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios#request-config) for further information about the supported values.\n\n#### retryOnError (default: `true`)\n\nBy default, this SDK is retrying requests which resulted in a 500 server error and 429 rate limit response. Set this to `false` to disable this behavior.\n\n#### logHandler (default: `function (level, data) {}`)\n\nErrors and warnings will be logged by default to the node or browser console. Pass your own log handler to intercept here and handle errors, warnings and info on your own.\n\n#### requestLogger (default: `function (config) {}`)\n\nInterceptor called on every request. Takes Axios request config as an arg. Default does nothing. Pass your own function to log any desired data.\n\n#### responseLogger (default: `function (response) {}`)\n\nInterceptor called on every response. Takes Axios response object as an arg. Default does nothing. Pass your own function to log any desired data.\n\n### Reference documentation\n\nThe [Contentful's JS SDK reference](https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js) documents what objects and methods are exposed by this library, what arguments they expect and what kind of data is returned.\n\nMost methods also have examples which show you how to use them.\n\nYou can start by looking at the top level `contentfulManagement` namespace.\n\nThe `ContentfulClientAPI` namespace defines the methods at the Client level which allow you to create and get spaces.\n\nThe `ContentfulSpaceAPI` namespace defines the methods at the Space level which allow you to create and get entries, assets, content types and other possible entities.\n\nThe `Entry`, `Asset` and `ContentType` namespaces show you the instance methods you can use on each of these entities, once you retrieve them from the server.\n\n> From version 1.0.0 onwards, you can access documentation for a specific version by visiting `https://contentful.github.io/contentful-management.js/contentful-management/<VERSION>`\n\n### Contentful JavaScript resources\n\nRead the [Contentful for JavaScript](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/javascript/) page for Tutorials, Demo Apps, and more information on other ways of using JavaScript with Contentful\n\n### REST API reference\n\nThis library is a wrapper around our Contentful Management REST API. Some more specific details such as search parameters and pagination are better explained on the [REST API reference](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-management-api/), and you can also get a better understanding of how the requests look under the hood.\n\n### Legacy contentful-management.js\n\nFor versions prior to 1.0.0, you can access documentation at [https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js/tree/legacy](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.js/tree/legacy)\n\n## Versioning\n\nThis project strictly follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) by use of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).\n\nThis means that new versions are released automatically as fixes, features or breaking changes are released.\n\nYou can check the changelog on the [releases](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js/releases) page.\n\n## Migration from contentful-management.js 3.x\n\nThe bundle for browsers is now called `contentful-management.browser.min.js` to mark it clearly as browser only bundle. If you need to support IE 11 or other old browsers, you may use the `contentful-management.legacy.min.js`. Node will automatically use the `contentful-management.node.min.js` while bundlers like Webpack will resolve to the new ES-modules version of the library.\n\nNo changes to the API of the library were made.\n\n## Migration from contentful-management.js 1.x and older\n\ncontentful.js 1.x was a major rewrite, with some API changes. While the base functionality remains the same, some method names have changed, as well as some internal behaviors.\n\nSee the [migration guide](MIGRATION.md) for more information.\n\n## Support\n\nIf you have a problem with this library, please file an [issue](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.js/issues/new) here on GitHub.\n\nIf you have other problems with Contentful not related to this library, you can contact [Customer Support](https://support.contentful.com).\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
