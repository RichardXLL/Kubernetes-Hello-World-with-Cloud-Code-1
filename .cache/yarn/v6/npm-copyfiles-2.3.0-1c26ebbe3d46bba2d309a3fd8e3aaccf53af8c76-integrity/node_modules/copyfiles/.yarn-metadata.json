[boolean]\n    -f, --flat     flatten the output                                    [boolean]\n    -e, --exclude  pattern or glob to exclude (may be passed multiple times)\n    -E, --error    throw error if nothing is copied                      [boolean]\n    -V, --verbose  print more information to console                     [boolean]\n    -s, --soft     do not overwrite destination files if they exist      [boolean]\n    -F, --follow   follow symbolink links                                [boolean]\n    -v, --version  Show version number                                   [boolean]\n    -h, --help     Show help                                             [boolean]\n```\n\ncopy some files, give it a bunch of arguments, (which can include globs), the last one\nis the out directory (which it will create if necessary).  Note: on windows globs must be **double quoted**, everybody else can quote however they please.\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles foo foobar foo/bar/*.js out\n```\n\nyou now have a directory called out, with the files foo and foobar in it, it also has a directory named foo with a directory named\nbar in it that has all the files from foo/bar that match the glob.\n\nIf all the files are in a folder that you don't want in the path out path, ex:\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles something/*.js out\n```\n\nwhich would put all the js files in `out/something`, you can use the `--up` (or `-u`) option\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles -u 1 something/*.js out\n```\n\nwhich would put all the js files in `out`\n\nyou can also just do -f which will flatten all the output into one directory, so with files ./foo/a.txt and ./foo/bar/b.txt\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles -f ./foo/*.txt ./foo/bar/*.txt out\n```\n\nwill put a.txt and b.txt into out\n\nif your terminal doesn't support globstars then you can quote them\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles -f ./foo/**/*.txt out\n```\n\ndoes not work by default on a mac\n\nbut\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles -f \"./foo/**/*.txt\" out\n```\n\ndoes.\n\nYou could quote globstars as a part of input:\n```bash\ncopyfiles some.json \"./some_folder/*.json\" ./dist/ && echo 'JSON files copied.'\n```\n\nYou can use the -e option to exclude some files from the pattern, so to exclude all all files ending in .test.js you could do\n\n```bash\ncopyfiles -e \"**/*.test.js\" -f ./foo/**/*.js out\n```\n\nOther options include\n\n- `-a` or `--all` which includes files that start with a dot.\n- `-s` or `--soft` to soft copy, which will not overwrite existing files.\n- `-F` or `--follow` which follows symbolinks\n\n## copyup\n\nalso creates a `copyup` command which is identical to `copyfiles` but `-up` defaults to 1\n\n### Programic API\n\n```js\nvar copyfiles = require('copyfiles');\n\ncopyfiles([paths], opt, callback);\n```\ntakes an array of paths, last one is the destination path, also takes an optional argument which the -u option if a number, otherwise if it's `true` it's the flat option or if it is an object it is a hash of the various options (the long version e.g. up, all, flat, exclude, error, verbose, follow, and soft)  \n",
