    "readme": "# Netlify CMS App\n_For a Netlify CMS overview, see the general [Netlify CMS project README](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms)._\n\n## Community Chat\n\n<a href=\"https://netlifycms.org/chat\">\n  <img alt=\"Join us on Slack\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netlify/netlify-cms/master/website/static/img/slack.png\" width=\"165\">\n</a>\n\n## Purpose\nThis package is similar to the [`netlify-cms`](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/tree/master/packages/netlify-cms/) package, but is designed for use with extensions. It serves that purpose in the following ways.\n\n- It does not automatically initialize - you must run the CMS `init` method.\n- It does not include `react` or `react-dom` - they are required as peer dependencies.\n- It does not include the following extensions:\n  - [`netlify-cms-media-library-cloudinary`]\n  - [`netlify-cms-media-library-uploadcare`]\n  \n## Usage\nInstall via script tag:\n\n```html\n<!-- Excluding `doctype` and `head` but you should add them -->\n<body>\n  <!-- Add these scripts to the bottom of the body -->\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@^16/umd/react.production.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@^16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js\"></script>\n  <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms-app/dist/netlify-cms-app.js\"></script>\n  \n  <!-- Initialize the CMS -->\n  <script>\n    NetlifyCmsApp.init();\n  </script>\n</body>\n```\n\nInstall via npm:\n\n```\nnpm i react react-dom netlify-cms-app\n```\n\n```js\nimport CMS from 'netlify-cms-app';\n\nCMS.init();\n```\n",
