We got your focus and will not let him out!\n\n[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/focus-lock.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/react-focus-lock/)\n\n# Consumers\n\nThis is a base package for:\n  - [react-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock)\n  [![downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/react-focus-lock)](https://www.npmtrends.com/react-focus-lock)\n  - [vue-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/vue-focus-lock)\n  [![downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/vue-focus-lock)](https://www.npmtrends.com/vue-focus-lock)\n  - [dom-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/dom-focus-lock)\n  [![downloads](https://badgen.net/npm/dm/dom-focus-lock)](https://www.npmtrends.com/dom-focus-lock)\n\nProvides a low level API, to be used by final realization. Usually everything\ncan be solved in 3 lines\n```js\nimport moveFocusInside, { focusInside } from 'focus-lock';\n\nif (topNode && !focusInside(topNode)) {\n  moveFocusInside(topNode, lastActiveFocus);\n}\n```\n\n# WHY?\nFrom [MDN Article about accessible dialogs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques/Using_the_dialog_role):\n - The dialog must be properly labeled\n - Keyboard __focus must be managed__ correctly\n \nThis one is about managing the focus.\n\nI'v got a good [article about focus management, dialogs and  WAI-ARIA](https://medium.com/@antonkorzunov/its-a-focus-trap-699a04d66fb5).    \n\n# Focus fighting\nIt is possible, that more that one \"focus management system\" is present on the site.\nFor example you are using FocusLock for your content, and also using some\nModal dialog, with FocusTrap inside.\n\nBoth system will try to do their best, and move focus into their managed areas.\nStack overflow. Both are dead.\n\nFocus Lock(React-Focus-Lock, Vue-Focus-Lock and so on) implements anti-fighting\nprotection - once the battle is detected focus-lock will surrender(as long there is no way to win this fight).\n\nYou may also land a peace by special data attribute - `data-no-focus-lock`(constants.FOCUS_ALLOW). It will\nremove focus management from all nested elements, letting you open modals, forms, or \nuse any third party component safely. Focus lock will just do nothing, while focus is on the marked elements. \n\n# API\n\n`default(topNode, lastNode)` (aka setFocus), moves focus inside topNode, keeping in mind that last focus inside was - lastNode\n \n# Licence\n MIT\n \n \n",
